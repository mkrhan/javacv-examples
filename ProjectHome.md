javacv-examples provides examples of computer vision algorithms based on [JavaCV](https://code.google.com/p/javacv/)/[OpenCV](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/) in Scala, Java, and other Java Virtual Machine (JVM) languages. Demonstrates how to integrate JavaCV with JVM based imaging tools like [ImageJ](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) and Java Advanced Imaging Toolkit.

[The first set](OpenCV2_Cookbook_Examples.md) of examples is translation of C++ code provided in the book  “[OpenCV 2 Computer Vision Application Programming Cookbook](http://www.laganiere.name/opencvCookbook/)” by Robert Laganière.
